# sprat
sprat = shitty python rat

Don't use this to infect computers you don't own, or do, I can't stop you.

I built this out of boredom and to practice my python skills. I'm new at python so don't cringe at my code ðŸ˜¡

This project is based on Python3.9.5 and works only on Windows 10, unless you use an older version of python (3.8 or less) then you can run it on Win7
